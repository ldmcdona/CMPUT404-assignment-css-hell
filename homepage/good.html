    A Little About Me:
</h1>
<p>
    Hello, my name is Liam McDonald, I'm a 4th year student at the University of Alberta, Majoring in Computing Sciences. <br>
    I have covered a wide range of materials in my studies, including database management, reinforcement learning, web applications, and <br>
    others. My interests include creative writing, self-improvement, tabletop role-playing games, and helping people with personal projects. <br>
    This is me. <br>

<h2>
    My Professional History:
</h2>
<p>
    Unfortunetly I'm currently lacking in terms of a standard professional work history, however, I had done all the following:<br>
    <h4 class="list">
        1. Worked as a general laborer for a number of local buisnesses. <br>
        2. Worked as a cashier for a concession stand. <br>
        3. Worked as a volenteer for a local festival. <br>
        4. Worked as both a writer and programmer on the following student projects: <br>

    What I Can Do For Your Company:
</h3>
<p>
    If university has taught me anything it is that when it's time to work it doesn't matter what you are doing or who you are working with, <br>
    you have to work hard, and you have to work together. It is because of this belief that I have managed to get as far as I have in my <br>
    post-secondary education, and if giving a position I will apply this belief wherever I am placed. I'm a fast learner, I try my best to get <br>
    along with everyone, and I while I may be more laid back than most I really do work hard. <br>
